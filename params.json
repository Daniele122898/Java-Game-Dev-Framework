  "body": "### Commented on every major line\r\nI tried to comment on every major line of code so that it would be as easy as possible to understand what each line does. The Code is also written clean and I used more Classes then needed to make it easier to follow and understand. \r\n\r\n###Aim\r\nThe aim of this Framework is to:\r\n* Give newcomers an easy Framework to work with and instantly start programming their games\r\n* Lines are commented for the newcomers to understand each step and thus create their own framework or expand this one.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nAs a Game Development Framework it features everything you need to create easy games. There is an input handler, game loop (which you can edit the FPS you want by changing the thread.sleep(x) time, game thread, Jframe with changable name and res ofcourse, States and Resource management. Everything you need ;)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am the sole autor of this Framework and did it with the help of different Java books. I want this to be open source so people can contribute and expand it's features! Let the Framework expand!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me via Github, that should be enough for the start. ",
